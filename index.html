<p style="font-size:20px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Hello! <br><br>

I have a couple of tutorials that I am working on. <br><br>

Here is the link to GLMM's and non-linear models in R and Python: <br>
<a href="https://bromsk.github.io/BayesInPython/">https://bromsk.github.io/BayesInPython/</a> <br><br>

Here are links to some data visualizations and dashboards in Shiny. They are not fancy, but they help communicate data exploration and results to STEM colleagues. <br>
Visualizing generalized logistic curves and their affects (model development): <br>

A prototype for a data input form: <br>
